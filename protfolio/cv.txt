This is my CV .
I am Creating my own portfolio website with the basics of html and css.
Learning new things brings both joy and frustration.
And development sits on the top of the frustration pyramid.
Sadly, most job offers require that you both design and develop websites nowadays, 
So knowing how to code at least some front-end is crucial as a UX/UI designer.


The same principle can be made with HTML. If you’re not developing in SPA environments like Gatsby.
You can use PHP to include and require pieces of HTML code.

It’s important to merge them because you want to minimize,
the number of HTTP requests your website does.
